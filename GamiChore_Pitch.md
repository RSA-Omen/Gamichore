# GamiChore
## Turn chores into habits

---

# The problem

Kids don't do their chores.

- Nagging doesn't scale
- Allowance feels disconnected from effort
- You don't know if they're building habits or just going through the motions

---

# The insight

Chores become habits when they're:

1. **Visible** – kids see what's due and what they've earned  
2. **Rewarding** – stars feel earned, not given  
3. **Trackable** – you see patterns, not just today

# GamiChore in 30 seconds

A chore app that lets kids **earn stars** for completed tasks and **spend them** in a parent-defined shop.

Parents approve completions. Kids redeem rewards. No nagging. No guessing.

# Why stars?

- **Instant feedback** – kid completes a chore, gets stars right away  
- **Delayed gratification** – save up for bigger rewards  
- **No cash** – you control what’s in the shop (ice cream trip, screen time, pick the movie)  
- **Flexible** – different chores = different star values

---

# Core flow

1. Parent sets up **chores** and **chore sets** (daily, weekly, monthly)  
2. Parent assigns sets to **kids**  
3. Kids mark chores done → parent **approves**  
4. Kids spend stars in the **shop**  
5. Parent sees **what’s done, what’s pending, and how often they skip**

# The habit tracker

**The differentiator.**

Not just "did they do it today?" – you see **when they do it vs when they skip** over the last 4 weeks.

- Green = all done  
- Yellow = partial  
- Red = skipped  
- Completion rate, streaks, and patterns at a glance

---

# Why the habit tracker matters

- **Spot patterns** – Tuesday mornings? Weekend slumps?  
- **Adjust difficulty** – too many red days? Simplify the set.  
- **Celebrate consistency** – highlight green streaks.  
- **No more "I always do my chores"** – the data tells the story.

# Who it's for

- Parents who want **less nagging** and **more accountability**  
- Families with **multiple kids** and different chore sets  
- Anyone who wants to **turn chores into habits** instead of one-off tasks

---

# Tech that fits

- **PWA** – works on phone, tablet, desktop; add to home screen  
- **Optional Android app** – native install via Capacitor  
- **Offline-first** – local storage, no account required to try it  
- **Themes** – warm cream, ocean breeze, forest, neon dark mode
